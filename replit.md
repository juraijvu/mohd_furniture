# Furniture Color Customizer

## Overview

A web-based furniture customization application that allows users to upload furniture images, select specific regions, and apply custom colors from a company palette. The system provides realistic color rendering that maintains shadows and textures, with capabilities to save, share, and export customized designs.

**Core Functionality:**
- Upload furniture images (sofa, chair, table, etc.)
- Select regions using drawing tools (manual polygon/brush or auto-detection)
- Apply colors from predefined company palette
- Realistic color blending with texture preservation
- Save/download/submit customizations for quotation

## Recent Changes

**November 2, 2025 - AI-Powered Click-to-Color Redesign:**
- **MAJOR REDESIGN**: Replaced manual drawing tools with AI-powered automatic furniture part detection
- Integrated Replicate API with Meta's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for intelligent image segmentation
- New interaction model: Users simply click on any furniture part to automatically detect and color it
- Removed Fabric.js dependency and manual shape drawing (rectangle, circle tools)
- Implemented HTML5 Canvas with mask overlay system for precise color application
- Added real-time segmentation with loading states and error handling
- Backend: New `/api/segment` endpoint processes click coordinates and returns AI-detected masks
- Database schema updated: New tables for `segmentationMasks` and `colorApplications`
- User-friendly workflow: Upload → Click any part → Color is automatically applied
- No Photoshop skills required - perfect for non-technical users
- Cost-effective: ~$0.013 per segmentation (~76 clicks per $1)

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework:** React.js with TypeScript, bundled using Vite

**UI Component System:** 
- shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design tokens
- "New York" style variant with CSS variables for theming
- Component library includes: dialogs, buttons, forms, cards, tooltips, and specialized UI elements

**Canvas/Image Editing:**
- HTML5 Canvas for mask overlay and color rendering
- AI-powered image segmentation via Replicate API (Meta SAM 2)
- Click-based interaction: automatic furniture part detection on click
- Real-time color blending with multiply composite operation
- Zoom controls and download functionality

**State Management:**
- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state and data fetching
- Local React state for UI interactions and canvas operations
- Session-based state persistence

**Routing:**
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- Single-page application with Home and NotFound routes

**Design System:**
- Reference-based approach inspired by professional design tools (Figma, Canva, Adobe Creative Cloud)
- Three-panel desktop layout: Left sidebar (320px), center canvas (fluid), right properties panel (280px)
- Responsive with collapsible sidebars for tablet and bottom sheets for mobile
- Typography: Inter/Work Sans (UI), Outfit/Space Grotesk (headers), JetBrains Mono (code)
- Consistent spacing scale using Tailwind units (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16)

### Backend Architecture

**Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js

**API Design:**
- RESTful API endpoints for project and image management
- File upload handling via Multer with validation
- Supported image formats: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- 10MB file size limit for uploads

**Database ORM:**
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- PostgreSQL dialect configuration
- Schema-driven with Zod validation integration

**Key Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/upload` - Image upload with file validation
- `GET /api/projects` - Fetch user projects
- CRUD operations for projects, images, color regions, and canvas states

**Build Process:**
- Development: tsx for TypeScript execution with hot reload
- Production: Vite for client build, esbuild for server bundling
- ESM module format throughout

### Data Storage

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**

1. **projects** - Furniture customization projects
   - id, name, description, previewImageUrl
   - Timestamps: createdAt, updatedAt

2. **projectImages** - Uploaded furniture images
   - id, projectId (FK), originalImagePath, mimeType
   - Dimensions: width, height
   - Cascade delete on project removal

3. **segmentationMasks** - AI-detected furniture parts
   - id, imageId (FK), clickX, clickY
   - maskData (base64 PNG), boundingBox (JSONB)
   - Stores SAM 2 generated masks for each click
   - Cascade delete on image removal

4. **colorApplications** - Applied colors to segmented parts
   - id, projectId (FK), maskId (FK)
   - fillHex, opacity, blendMode
   - Links colors to specific detected furniture parts
   - Cascade delete on project removal

5. **recentColors** - User's recent color selections
   - For quick color access in UI

**File Storage:**
- Local filesystem storage in `/uploads` directory
- Uploaded files served as static assets via Express
- UUID-based filenames to prevent collisions

**In-Memory Storage:**
- MemStorage class for user management (development/fallback)
